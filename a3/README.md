# CS158a - Assignment 3: Leader Election in a Ring

This project implements the O(nÂ²) leader election algorithm for an asynchronous ring of processes. Each process (`myleprocess.py`) acts as both a client and a server, forming a node in a distributed ring. On startup, each process generates a unique ID (UUID) and participates in an election to designate a single leader. Communication is done via JSON-serialized messages over TCP sockets.

## How to Run the Local Demo

To demonstrate the leader election with three nodes on a single machine, you will need to open **three separate terminal windows**.

### 1. Prerequisite Files

Before running, ensure you have three configuration files in your project directory to form the ring.

**`config1.txt`**
```
127.0.0.1,5001
127.0.0.1,5002
```

**`config2.txt`**
```
127.0.0.1,5002
127.0.0.1,5003
```

**`config3.txt`**
```
127.0.0.1,5003
127.0.0.1,5001
```

### 2. Execution

Navigate to the project directory (`a3`) in each of the three terminals. Then, run the following commands, one in each terminal, in quick succession.

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
python3 myleprocess.py config1.txt log1.txt
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
python3 myleprocess.py config2.txt log2.txt
```

**Terminal 3:**
```bash
python3 myleprocess.py config3.txt log3.txt
```

The scripts will connect to each other, perform the election, print logs to the console and respective log files, and terminate after agreeing on a leader.

## Execution Example

Below is the sample output from a successful run across the three terminals.
